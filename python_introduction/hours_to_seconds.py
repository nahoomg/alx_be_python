# Define the number of hours to be converted
hours = 2

# Calculate the number of seconds.
# There are 60 minutes in an hour, and 60 seconds in a minute,
# so 1 hour = 60 * 60 = 3600 seconds.
seconds = hours * 3600

# Print the result in the specified format
print(f"{hours} hour(s) is {seconds} seconds.")
