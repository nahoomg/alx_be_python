# Define the principal amount (P), annual interest rate (R), and time in years (T)
principal = 1000  # Initial investment of $1000
rate = 0.05       # 5% annual interest rate (as a decimal)
time = 3          # 3 years

# Calculate the simple interest using the formula: I = P * R * T
interest = principal * rate * time

# Print the calculated interest in the specified format
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
